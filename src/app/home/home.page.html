                        Dankie Jesu is a Christian clothing brand that caters for all genders, all races, and all ages.
                        It
                        started off as a hashtag started by the founder and designer, Lunga Duma at his church
                        Assemblies Of
                        God Kagiso in 2015.

                        He then designed his first T-shirt and sold all the merchandise thereafter from his car boot in
                        2017. The brand grew, expanded and was officially launched in 2018, 16 June at Assemblies Of God
                        Kagiso, and now has opened its doors at 5630 Moilwa Street, Kagiso.
